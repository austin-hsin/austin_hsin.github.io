Welcome to a small little easter egg featuring some of my favorite cats in I've had the fortune of meeting and interacting with.

This is Pepper as a kitten on the first day my friend adopted him.

And this is Pepper a little grown up.

This is Truffle, she's a little tuckered out at the moment (and yes, she sleeps like this).

And finally, here is Dubu, a handsome voidling who loves cuddles and scritches.
