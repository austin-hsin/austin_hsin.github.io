# Introduction

Welcome to my website! 

My name is Austin, I'm a 2nd year MPH student at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in the Epidemiology department with a certificate in Chronic Disease Epidemiology.

This website was created for an assignment under the mentorship of Jeff Goldsmith through his [Data Science I](https://p8105.com/index.html) course.

Feel free to head over to my [about page](about.html) to learn more about my academic and professional background or explore the rest of the site via the menu on the top right.

Here is a [plot.ly flexdashboard](nyc_inspections_flexboard.html) that I also created for the assignment.

Stay as long as you'd like, I'll be here working on other projects.
